# Live Sentiment Mining from Twitter

Code repository for mining social media sites for data and performing sentiment analysis and support prediction. __*The above project is still under development to implement new features and use the mined data for new types of analysis.*__

Tried after reading @bonzanini 's blog and book: [Mastering Social Media Mining with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-social-media-mining-python)

## Setting up the environment

Requirements: Python 3.4+

It's strongly recommended to create a virtual environment with `conda`.

Download `Anaconda Distribution`:
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Install it following the required steps.

Test your installation, in your Terminal window or Anaconda Prompt,
run the command:
```
conda list
```
For a successful installation, a list of installed packages appears.

You can update all packages in conda anytime using:
```
conda update --all
```
To install NLTK, open your python shell and type:
```
import nltk
nltk.download()
```
